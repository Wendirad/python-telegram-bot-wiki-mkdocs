If you still have problems with **this** library, feel free to join the [official group chat on Telegram](https://t.me/pythontelegrambotgroup).

If your country is limited and you cannot send messages to public groups, you can make use of our [IRC Bridge to the group](https://webchat.freenode.net/?channels=#%23python-telegram-bot). You will need a nick (without spaces), and you can omit the password (it is optional).

You may also ask on [StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/), if you prefer.
