## Introduction
The extension class `telegram.ext.JobQueue` allows you to perform tasks with a delay or even periodically, at a set interval. Among many other things, you can use it to send regular updates to your subscribers.

## Usage
The `JobQueue` class is tightly integrated with other `telegram.ext` classes. Similar to `Updater` and `Dispatcher`, it runs asynchronously in a separate thread.

To use the `JobQueue`, you don't have to do much. When you instantiate the `Updater`, it will create a `JobQueue` for you:

```python
import telegram.ext
from telegram.ext import Updater

u = Updater('TOKEN', use_context=True)
j = u.job_queue
```

This job queue is also linked to the dispatcher, which is discussed later in this article. Just know that unless you have a good reason to do so, you should not instantiate `JobQueue` yourself.

Tasks in the job queue are encapsulated by the `Job` class. It takes a callback function as a parameter, which will be executed when the time comes. This callback function always takes one parameter: `context`, a `telegram.ext.CallbackContext`. Like in the case of handler callbacks used by the `Dispatcher`, through this object you can access `context.bot`, the `Updater`'s `telegram.Bot` instance; and for this particular case you can also access `context.job`, which is the `Job` instance of the task that triggered the callback (more on that later). 

You can use the following 3 methods to create jobs with different frequency and time: `job_queue.run_once`, `job_queue.run_repeating`, `job_queue.run_daily` and `job_queue.run_monthly`. (As before, you do not usually need to instantiate the `Job` class directly.)

### Tutorial

Add your first job to the queue by defining a callback function and adding it to the job queue. For this tutorial, you can replace `'@examplechannel'` with a channel where your bot is an admin, or by your user id (use [@userinfobot](https://telegram.me/userinfobot) to find out your user id):

```python
def callback_minute(context: telegram.ext.CallbackContext):
    context.bot.send_message(chat_id='@examplechannel', 
                             text='One message every minute')

job_minute = j.run_repeating(callback_minute, interval=60, first=0)
```

*(Ignore the type annotations if you're on Python 2)*

The `callback_minute` function will be executed every `60.0` seconds, the first time being right now (because of `first=0`). The `interval` and `first` parameters are in seconds if they are `int` or `float`. They can also be `datetime` objects. See the [docs](http://python-telegram-bot.readthedocs.io/en/stable/telegram.ext.jobqueue.html) for detailed explanation.
The return value of these functions are the `Job` objects being created. You don't need to store the result of `run_repeating` (which is the newly instantiated `Job`) if you don't need it; we will make use of it later in this tutorial.

You can also add a job that will be executed only once, with a delay:

```python
def callback_30(context: telegram.ext.CallbackContext):
    context.bot.send_message(chat_id='@examplechannel', 
                             text='A single message with 30s delay')

j.run_once(callback_30, 30)
```

In thirty seconds you should receive the message from `callback_30`. 

If you are tired of receiving a message every minute, you can temporarily disable a job or even completely remove it from the queue:

```python
job_minute.enabled = False  # Temporarily disable this job
job_minute.schedule_removal()  # Remove this job completely
```

**Note:** `schedule_removal` does not immediately remove the job from the queue. Instead, it is marked for removal and will be removed as soon as its current interval is over (it will not run again after being marked for removal).

A job can also change its own behavior, as it is passed to the callback function as the second argument:

```python
def callback_increasing(context: telegram.ext.CallbackContext):
    job = context.job
    context.bot.send_message(chat_id='@examplechannel',
                             text='Sending messages with increasing delay up to 10s, then stops.')
    job.interval += 1.0
    if job.interval > 10.0:
        job.schedule_removal()

j.run_repeating(callback_increasing, 1)
```

This job will send a first message after one second, a second message after two _more_ seconds, a third message after _three more_ seconds, and so on. After the ten messages, the job will terminate itself.

You might want to add jobs in response to certain user input, and there is a convenient way to do that. All `Handler` classes can pass the job queue into their callback functions, if you need them to. To do that, simply set `pass_job_queue=True` when instantiating the Handler. Another feature you can use here is the `context` keyword argument of `Job`. You can pass any object as a `context` parameter when you launch a Job and retrieve it at a later stage as long as the Job exists. Let's see how it looks in code:

```python
from telegram.ext import CommandHandler
def callback_alarm(context: telegram.ext.CallbackContext):
    context.bot.send_message(chat_id=context.job.context, text='BEEP')

def callback_timer(update: telegram.Update, context: telegram.ext.CallbackContext):
    context.bot.send_message(chat_id=update.message.chat_id,
                             text='Setting a timer for 1 minute!')

    context.job_queue.run_once(callback_alarm, 60, context=update.message.chat_id)

timer_handler = CommandHandler('timer', callback_timer)
u.dispatcher.add_handler(timer_handler)
```

By placing the `chat_id` in the `Job` object, the callback function knows where it should send the message.

All good things must come to an end, so when you stop the Updater, the related job queue will be stopped as well:

```python
u.stop()
```

Of course, you can instead also stop the job queue by itself:

```python
j.stop()
```
