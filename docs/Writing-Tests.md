In case you want to practice [test-driven development](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test-driven_development), or ensure your bot still works after consecutive changes ([regression bugs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_regression) are rather common for chatbots), you should write test cases.

## Unit Tests
Unit tests are performed on a logically encapsulated component of the system. The definition of unit tests in contrast to integration tests is that they have no external dependencies.
@Eldinnie has written an initial POC of a unit test framework for python-telegram-bot, but as the library grew it was not maintained. Perhaps you might be able to help us out here and help in completing the project ;)

## Integration Tests
In contrast to unit tests, integration tests may test the system in its eventual environment together with service integrations, such as the Bot API.

In order to test your bot in a real environment, you can make use of a [userbot](http://telegra.ph/How-a-Userbot-superacharges-your-Telegram-Bot-07-09) library that will send messages to your bot and evaluate whether it responds in the way it should. [Telethon](https://github.com/LonamiWebs/Telethon) or [Pyrogram](https://github.com/pyrogram/pyrogram) should be the choices in a Python environment.
The currently unmaintained [TgIntegration library](https://github.com/JosXa/tgintegration/) was written for exactly this purpose, so maybe someone could come along with a pull request to update it to the latest version of Pyrogram.


## Feature Tests
We are testing features of our bot using behave python module and using python-telegram-bot.
I am implementing this concept on this repo [chat bots behave test](https://github.com/mmdaz/feature_testing_chat_bots)
I will be happy if I get comments and pull requests for improving it.
